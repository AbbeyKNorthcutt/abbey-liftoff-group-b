**_Project Title: Online Banking_**

1 – Overview

We’re developing a banking application that is going to reshape how you bank and budget. Banking Made easy will allow you to create a profile, upload and track your expenses to make budgeting easier as well as allow for the user to see banking statements. You will be able to use the app as a personal wallet.

2 – Features

Authentication / Existing User login

New User Registration
>> Post successful registration, the user enters credentials for logging in. On successful authentication, the user can carry out their personal banking activities like checking/savings accounts, using personal wallet, etc.

Reset Password
>> A user can reset their password in case they forget their password to log in to their account by providing their Email address.

Add banking cards/ gift cards and view available balance and reward points with the Personal Wallet 
>> A User can add their banking cards/ gift cards in the personal wallet feature for them to use to pay for their expenses or transfer money to other accounts. A User can also see the available balance and rewards points.

Search for ATMs/Branches
