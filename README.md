**_Project Title: Online Banking_**

1 – Overview

We’re developing a banking application that is going to reshape how you bank and budget. Banking Made easy will allow you to create a profile, upload and track your expenses to make budgeting easier as well as allow for the user to see banking statements. You will be able to use the app as a personal wallet.

2 – Features

>> Local Authentication / User login and registration:
> The user registers using identifiers.The application stores user credentials in the database.
The application sends a verification email/message to validate the registration.
Post successful registration, the user enters credentials for logging in.
On successful authentication, the user is allowed access to specific resources.

> A User can schedule an appointment with a bank advisor to learn more about the investments they can make. A user can choose a date and time using the calendar provided and enter their email address to get notified about their appointment.
